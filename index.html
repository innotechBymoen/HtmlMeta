            <h3>According to Wikipedia</h3>
            <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯,
                sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such
                as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key
                ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯, "vinegared rice").
            </p>
            <p>The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi
                most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo
                period (1603－1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.
            </p>
            <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
                short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna
                or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger
                (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the
                dish.
            </p>
            <p>Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly
                sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.
